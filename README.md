This repo is an exercise for potential candidates wishing to take up a role as android developer.
To take up this exercise, create a branch with your name and date in the format `firstName-lastName-yyyy-MM-dd`. When you're done, create a pull request against the `main` branch and request review.

Objective:
The objective of this exercise is to test the understanding of the candidate on basic development principles including clean code. Key evaluation aspect include:
1. Making efficient API calls
2. Updating UI with dynamic data from an API service
3. Providing offline access for data that is available from an API service.
4. Clean code

For a matter of time, you need to sign up to [TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/getting-started) to get access to free movie information API.
You need to develop an android app with kotlin that will:
1. Display popular movies (Image, title and rating) in a Grid
2. Enable a user to favourite a movie. When a user favourites a movie, it should be available offline. This means a user must be able to view the list and details of their favourite movies even when they are offline.
3. Display the list of their favourite movies.

Note: 
Try to be as simple as possible. No UI design is provided so you're free to be creative in that space but yet stay simple.

Time:
You have a maximum of 5 days to complete this task. 

All the best
